## The AI Software Development Lifecycle Revolution

The way we build software is fundamentally changing. AI is no longer just a feature we ship - it's reshaping how we write code, collaborate, and deliver value.

Agentic Dev Days Stockholm brings together 300 developers, engineers, and technical leaders for a full-day deep dive into the practices, tools, and mindsets defining AI-native development. This conference scales up our monthly meetups - which consistently gather 100 participants - to create a comprehensive gathering where the entire Nordic AI development community can connect, learn, and advance the field together.

## A Community-Driven Conference

Agentic Dev Days Stockholm is a self-organizing, practitioner-focused event. We're built on partnerships and ticket sales, which means we can focus entirely on creating value for the community and keep ticket prices accessible to all practitioners.

### Our Philosophy

- We build real connections for further developing the field
- Knowledge sharing over product presentations
- Authentic community building, not lead generation
- Engineers talking to engineers about real challenges and solutions

## Reach Decision-Makers

These aren't tire-kickers. Our attendees are hands-on practitioners who evaluate tools, architect systems, and influence technical strategy at their organizations. They come from leading AI companies and innovative startups across the Nordic region.

## Nordic AI Hub

Stockholm is emerging as a center for AI innovation in Europe. This conference creates a unique opportunity to connect with developers building the future across the entire Nordic ecosystem - a scale impossible to achieve through monthly meetups alone.

## The Best Way to Participate

**Send your engineers.** Not your marketing team - send the people actually building with AI tools and solving real challenges.

**Engage in open spaces.** Lead discussions, share lessons learned.

**Skip the pitch.** Heavy marketing backfires - thoughtful technical engagement wins.
